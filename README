I just got a SanDisk sansa clip zip and was annoyed that my Mac wasn't really able to worh with it.  That is going to change.

This project is meant to ease the process of making playlists and uploading to the sansa.  

Written in Python with a Qt gui frontend it handles copy, filtering, and playlist creation.

Just a dream. A vision but no code at all.
